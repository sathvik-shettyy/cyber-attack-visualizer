# Cyber Attack Visualizer - Libraries and Frameworks

In the development of the Cyber Attack Visualizer project, various libraries and frameworks were utilized to enhance functionality, streamline processes, and create a seamless user experience. Here is a list of the key libraries and frameworks employed:

## Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight web framework for Python. In Cyber Attack Visualizer, Flask is used to create a web application that serves real-time data and facilitates the interaction between the server and clients. Its simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for developing the backend of our application.

```bash
pip install Flask
```

## Plotly

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/) is a versatile graphing library for creating interactive visualizations in Python. In this project, Plotly is instrumental in generating dynamic geographical maps and charts to represent cyber attack data. Its interactive features provide users with an engaging experience while exploring the global cyber threat landscape.

```bash
pip install plotly
```

## Socket.IO

[Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. Used in conjunction with Flask-SocketIO on the server side, Socket.IO enables bidirectional communication between the server and clients. This real-time capability ensures that the Cyber Attack Visualizer always displays the latest information on cyber attacks.

```bash
npm install socket.io-client
```

## Requests

[Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) is a simple HTTP library for making requests in Python. In this project, Requests is employed to fetch live cyber attack data from external sources. Its ease of use and powerful features make it an excellent choice for handling HTTP requests.

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Other Dependencies

The project may have additional dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Ensure to install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These libraries and frameworks collectively contribute to the robust and efficient operation of the Cyber Attack Visualizer, providing a rich user interface and ensuring accurate and timely data representation.
